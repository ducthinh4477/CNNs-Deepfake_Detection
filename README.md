## 📖 Introduction
This repository contains the source code and experimental results for my research project on **Deepfake Detection** and **Face Anti-Spoofing**. The project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to distinguish between real faces and fake/spoofed faces (generated by GANs, Diffusion models, or presentation attacks).

This work is part of a university project at **Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology and Education (HCMUTE)**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts to handle and augment face datasets.
- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of custom CNN models (MyNet) and comparison with state-of-the-art architectures.
- **Training Pipeline:** Full training loop with TensorFlow/Keras including callbacks (EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint).
- **Evaluation:** Metrics visualization (Accuracy, Loss, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC).
- **Inference:** Script to detect deepfakes on new images/videos.
